## Frequency distributions

#### Bencala, K. E., & Seinfeld, J. H. (1976). On frequency distributions of air pollutant concentrations. Atmospheric Environment (1967), 10(11), 941–950. doi:10.1016/0004-6981(76)90200-6 

Air pollution concentration levels are approximately in log-normal distribution - at different time averaging (hourly average, monthly, yearly etc). Some of this is explained by the near log-normal distribution of wind speeds (Mathematical proof by considering a 1-D flow equation). Mixing heights as well influence frequency distribution of air pollution concentrations. 

Will the distributions change based on emission levels? Based on source of emissions?- paper  found that only intercepts would be affected, not slopes (assuming that wind speeds are log-normal)

This paper restricted analysis to CO (because chemical reaction behaviour may effect distributions). 

### Applications with Frequency distributions
1. **Exceedances estimation:** If you want to estimate the number of exceedances of a pollutant in an area, but don't have a time series pollutant concentrations. You can use the distributions to make this estimation -- if you have a sample (preferably random) of concentration values.

```
Exceedances = Number of time units (hour, day, etc.,) in which the pollutant concentration exceeded the standard value (NAAQS).
```
